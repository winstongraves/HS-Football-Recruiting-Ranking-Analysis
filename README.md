# HS-Football-Recruiting-Ranking-Analysis
**This project uses data science and web scraping techniques to explore the long term accuracy of high school football recruiting rankings.** 

**Concepts demonstrated**: web-scraping, clustering, principal component analysis, probability theory, regression, tree-models, model-ensembling, model-stacking, undersampled subsets. 

## Data Used
Top 500 recruits each year from 2010-2017 with their ratings from 247, ESPN, and Rivals - [On3.com](https://on3.com)

## Problem Statement
Identifying and acquiring talent in any competitive industry is crucial to gain an advantage. The prevailing belief among people in & around the college football industry is that high school recruiting rankings are great predictors of individual success. Other research has even gone so far to say theyâ€™ve proven the relationship between recruit ranking and NFL draft status. Most say the higher rated a recruit the more likely they are to get drafted and therefore recruiting rankings are good predictors of success and draft status. 

## Results
After analyzing the relationship between draft status and recruit metrics (rating and stars) for the top 500 players from 2010-2017, the validity of the claim "recruiting rankings matter" is highly questionable. No evidence exists to confidently say that high school football recruiting rankings are predictive of NFL draft status and by proxy talent.
